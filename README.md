## üî¨ Abstract

This repository contains code and resources for a pilot, sleep-aware machine learning study on non-invasive glucose prediction using age-normalized heart rate variability (HRV) features derived from single-lead ECG. We analyze sleep-stage‚Äìspecific HRV (REM/Deep/‚ÄúRapid‚Äù) and show that simple age normalization of HRV improves regression performance under 5-fold cross-validation on a cohort of 43 subjects.

**Key Contributions:**
- Age-normalized HRV improves log-glucose prediction by ~25.6% R¬≤ over non-normalized HRV in this pilot.
- Sleep-stage‚Äìspecific features matter‚ÄîREM sleep features rank among the strongest predictors.
- Lightweight model: scikit-learn BayesianRidge with 5-fold CV; clear, reproducible baseline.
= Single-lead ECG compatibility; preliminary tolerance analysis suggests practical signal value (research only).

## Dataset
This repo expects overnight ECG + sleep staging + clinical glucose for 43 adult subjects. In the paper we used publicly available data "Dataset on electrocardiograph, sleep and metabolic function of male type 2 diabetes mellitus"[[1]](#1) from Mendeley Data(https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/9c47vwvtss/4):

## Method (in brief)

- **ECG ‚Üí RR intervals**: R-peak detection with artifact handling and outlier filtering.

- **Sleep stages**: Use provided labels (AASM criteria) to split RR intervals into REM / Deep Sleep (DS) / Rapid Sleep (RS) segments.

- **HRV features (per stage)**: Time-domain metrics ‚Äî Mean RR, RMSSD, SDNN, pNN50, range.

- **Age normalization**:
  $$
  \text{HRV}_{\text{age-norm}} = \frac{\text{HRV}_{\text{raw}}}{\frac{\text{age}}{65} + \epsilon}, \quad \epsilon = 0.1
  $$
  Applied to Mean RR in REM, DS, and RS stages.

- **Target engineering**: Natural log of glucose in mmol/L (ensure units are mmol/L before log-transform).

- **Feature selection**: Pearson correlation to log-glucose; retain features with *p* < 0.2 and keep top-*k* (e.g., 15) by absolute correlation |r|.

- **Model**: scikit-learn `BayesianRidge`; 5-fold cross-validation (random CV on samples).

- **Metrics**: R¬≤, MAE, Pearson *r* (with *p*-values), and tolerance (% within ¬±1.0 / ¬±1.5 / ¬±2.0 mmol/L).

## Reproducing Key Results (Pilot)

Using 5-fold cross-validation with `BayesianRidge`:

- **R¬≤** ‚âà 0.161 (¬±0.010)  
- **MAE** ‚âà 0.182 mmol/L  
- **Pearson r** ‚âà 0.409 (*p* < 0.001)  

### Ablation Study
- Age normalization improves R¬≤ by **~25.6%** compared to non-normalized HRV features.

### Tolerance (Prediction Accuracy)
- **~68.2%** within ¬±1.0 mmol/L  
- **~84.1%** within ¬±1.5 mmol/L  
- **~95.3%** within ¬±2.0 mmol/L  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: These are pilot, within-dataset cross-validation results intended for research purposes. They are **not clinical accuracy claims** and should not be interpreted as such.
